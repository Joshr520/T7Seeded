# T7Seeded
A COD: BO3 mod that enables seeded rng

# Instructions

## Downloading
- Download the T7Seeded zip from the latest release [here](https://github.com/Joshr520/T7Seeded/releases/latest)
- Extract the files to a location of your choosing (I prefer Black Ops 3 root directory in steam)
- That's it!

## Generating Seeds
- Run the "Generate Seed.bat" file
- You will be prompted to enter a seed or press enter to generate a random seed
- Valid seeds are any number from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (ONLY ENTER A NUMBER)
- By default, a random seed will be 10 characters long, but you can provide as many or as little as you like as long as it meets the criteria above

## Running the Seed
- Launch Black Ops 3 and load into the main menu screen
- Run the "Run.bat" file
- A terminal window will popup with on screen information
- It should have green text and say ```[scripts/shared/duplicaterender_mgr.gsc]: Injected"```
- From here you can leave this window open or close it, but don't press a key while this window is open as that will unload it
